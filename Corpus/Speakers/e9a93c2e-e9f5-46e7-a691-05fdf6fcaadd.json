            "Introducing the Line-Shape Diffuser": [
                "Inspired by the audio systems used at professional concerts, Sony's unique Line-Shape Diffuser creates line source and distributes the sound energy evenly, across a wide sound front, to better fill your space with audio. This spreads high-quality sound further and wider around your venue, without compromising on sound quality."

                "Unlike a conventional speaker, with most of the energy focused from the center of the cone, our unique Line-Shape Diffuser refocuses the sound through a narrow aperture. The increase in sound pressure energy spreads the audio equally in each direction both further and wider out from the speaker."

With extensive shock testing you can rest assure that this speaker will withstand inevitable drops, bumps and scrapes that come with everyday use."

                "The XE200 will give you up to 16-hours of play when the battery is fully charged, that means that a single charge should be long enough to power through any party. And Sony's unique mic sensing technology, Ambient Noise Sensing, helps save battery when used outside.6"
