                "Mica Reinforced Cellular cone for undistorted audioThe perfect partner for today's bass-driven music. Many speakers use paper cones that flex and deteriorate over time, leading to a more distorted sound. Mica Reinforced Cellular (MRC) fiber woofers are rigid, holding their shape even when moving at high pressure and speed, so you can drive the bass harder without compromising audio quality."

                "Power every beat with a built-in amplifierDrive bass-heavy music and bring your party alive. This subwoofer includes a built-in amplifier with up to 115 W power output. Electrical circuits susceptible to vibration are located outside the cabinet, releasing high pressure within the enclosure for a clear and powerful bass sound."

            "Minimizing vibration for tight bass": [
                "Minimizing vibration for tight bassSuppressing vibration in the cabinet is vital for tight, accurate bass. Unwanted vibrations are handled in two ways: by acoustically absorbing waves generated from the rear pressure of the unit, and damping vibrations within the cabinet itself. Designers optimized the type and layout of sound absorbing materials to keep cabinet vibration to a minimum."
