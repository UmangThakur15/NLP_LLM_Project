                "Enjoy music as the artist intended with High-Resolution AudioTake your digital music collection to another level with High-Resolution Audio. By digitally capturing music at a higher rate than CD, High-Resolution Audio allows you to get closer to the original studio recording and enjoy your music just as the artist intended."

            "Aluminum-coated LCP diaphragm for more precision": [
                "Aluminum-coated LCP diaphragm for more precisionAn aluminum-coated, liquid crystal polymer diaphragm gives a more consistent and precise sound across the entire frequency range than even a conventional LCP driver. High frequencies uniquely contained in High-Resolution Audio especially benefit from the added rigidity, and energy lost during transmission to the headphone housing is more uniform, ensuring a true and authentic performance."
            ],
            "Wide frequency response for a full range of sound": [
                "Wide frequency response for a full range of soundThe wide-band frequency range, spanning 3 Hz to 100 kHz1, is designed for a broad variety of music styles. Such a wide frequency response ensures even advanced audio formats, which require a much larger spectrum, can be accurately reproduced without hard limits or frequency roll-off, giving your music more life and realism."

            "Patterned grill for smooth ultra-highs": [
                "Patterned grill for smooth ultra-highsGrills help to protect the precision headphone diaphragm and are designed specifically for passing ultra-high frequencies without introducing \"color\" to the sound. The grill pattern is based on a Fibonacci sequence to ensure no frequency is boosted or cut. The result is a smooth, refined sound right across the frequency range."

            "Supplied balanced-connection headphone cable": [
                "Supplied balanced-connection headphone cableA 4.4\u03a6 balanced connection cable separates left and right sound signals completely, unlike conventional headphone cables which share a ground wire. This minimizes signal transmission loss and resulting sound deterioration, so you hear less distortion and cross-talk."

            "Silver-coated oxygen-free copper": [
                "Silver-coated oxygen-free copperThe MDR-1AM2 uses silver-coated oxygen-free copper cables, designed to minimize resistance and signal-transmission loss. The result is less sound degradation, finer detail, and smoother treble sounds."

            "Enfolding closed-back design seals in sound": [
                "Enfolding closed-back design seals in soundThe closed-back, enfolding design wraps around the ear, helping to seal in music and keep distractions out. Meticulously crafted acoustics ensure sound is exclusively directed towards your ears, so you hear even the subtlest of sounds. You'll also feel every beat, as the closed-back design helps to maximize the bass signatures in your music."
