                "Stereo sound creation with High-Resolution Audio capability",
                "By reproducing sound sources neutrally with High-Resolution Audio capability, each sound element can be monitored accurately. It assists the mixing and mastering stages by facilitating the capture of the feel of the venue and space, as well as the changes in sound details.",
                "Carefully tuned open-back acoustic structure",
                "When playing back spatial sound sources with headphones, the sound field is virtually reproduced by performing signal processing that considers HRTF for the spatial information of the sound source. By adopting an open back acoustic structure that does not acoustically close the housing, the reflected sound inside the headphones is reduced, enabling more accurate sound field reproduction. In addition, for optimal control of the airflow in front and back of the driver unit, the acoustic resistor is used as large area as possible to eliminate spatial resonance. Realizes natural and rich bass reproduction without coloring.",
                "Detachable cables for professional use",
                "The cable plug uses a 6.3 mm stereo standard plug widely used in production scenes. By using the bundled plug adaptor, it is also possible to connect to devices with 3.5 mm stereo mini jacks. The connection part to the main unit is detachable with a screw system, allowing for secure connection and cable replacement."
