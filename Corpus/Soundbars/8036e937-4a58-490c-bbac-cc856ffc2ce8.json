            "Omnidirectional Block Design": [

The design of the SA-SW5 is a perfect match for these systems. Its sophisticated rounded edges represent a single solid block providing wide-spreading sound. The combination of rich material textures emphasises an affinity with any living room environment."

            "\u03a3 Magnetic Circuit for deep, powerful bass": [
                "Sony\u2019s proprietary technology, the \u03a3 (Sigma) Magnetic Circuit enables deep, powerful bass by maximizing the magnetic force that drives the voice coil. By contrast, conventionally shaped circuits let much of this magnetic force leak away."

            "Separated Notch Edge": [
                "Another Sony proprietary technology, Separated Notch Edge improves vertical amplitude symmetry, an essential for clear sound quality. It achieves this using concentric cuts on the edge, which help to control the stress inside and outside the edge of the diaphragm."

            "Easy to set up": [
                "Simply power up the SA-SW5 subwoofer and it automatically makes a wireless connection with your HT-A9 Home Theater System or HT-A7000, HT-A5000 or HT-A3000 Soundbar. It\u2019s quick and easy with no need for messy cables.1"
